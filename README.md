Jordanian QA Community is a the first software quality assurance community in Jordan.

# Why we introduced the Idea?
* The field of Quality assurance should have the same importance as any other software development field, it is one of the primary and main phases of the software development steps.
* We need a community to get experience from each other and learn from each other.
